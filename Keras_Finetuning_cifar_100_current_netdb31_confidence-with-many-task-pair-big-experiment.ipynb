    "# Fine-Tuning `VGGNet` with `keras`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a single pipeline to resize, preprocess, and augment images in real time during training with `keras`. This eliminates the need to preprocess images and write them back to disk before doing fine-tuning. This is accomplished by hooking together `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` with `keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input()` via the former's (undocumented) `preprocessing_function` argument with a small wrapper function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook modifies [this tutorial](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) (full code [here](https://gist.github.com/fchollet/0830affa1f7f19fd47b06d4cf89ed44d)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be generalized to all keras [pretrained models](https://keras.io/applications/). For example, for `keras.applications.resnet50.ResNet50`, you would simply swap out `keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input()` for `keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input()`.\n",
